## 4. Information Architecture and Technical Design

### Information Architecture

      - /
        - /login
        - /tasks
        - /pomodoro
        - /stats
        - /settings

### Technical Design

| Tiers | Technology |
|     :---:      |     :---:      |
| Frontend | React + Tailwind CSS (quickly build responsive UI) |
| State Management | Zustand (lightweight) or Redux (normalized) |
| Timer | Custom React hook (usePomodoroTimer) |
| Data storage | Local Storage or Firebase Firestore (Cloud Storage) |
| Backend | Node.js + Express / Firebase Functions |

### Data structure (schematic)

    // Task example
    {
    id: "abc123",
    name: "Review React",
    priority: "high",
    deadline: "2.3.2025",
    tags: ["Learning"],
    completed: false,
    pomodoroCount: 3
    }
    
    // User example
    {
    uid: "user_001",
    name: "123",
    email: "...",
    createdAt: "...",
    stats: {
    totalPomodoros: 120,
    completedTasks: 65
    }
    }


## 5. Project Management and User Testing

### Project Management

| Management | Task |
|     :---:      |     :---:      |
| 1. Planning stage | Clarify the function list, draw UI prototype, and determine the technical solution |
| 2. MVP Phase | Login + Add Task + Pomodoro + Local Storage |
| 3. Extended functionality | Tag classification + Chart statistics + Firebase data synchronization |
| 4. User Testing | Invite 2~3 people to try it out, record the operation path, and collect feedback |
| 5. Deployment and launch | One-click deployment using Netlify / Vercel |

### User Testing

#### Objective: Confirm whether adding tasks and operating the Pomodoro timer are smooth

##### User tasks:

- Create a new task

- Start a Pomodoro timer

- Check which tasks are completed in a day

##### Record observation points:

- Are there any unclear steps

- Are the buttons unclear

- Is the page responsive
